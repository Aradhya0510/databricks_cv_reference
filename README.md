## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Databricks workspace with ML runtime
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.8+
- Ray 2.0+
- MLflow 2.0+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/databricks-cv-architecture.git
cd databricks-cv-architecture
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure Databricks:
```python
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

workspace = WorkspaceClient(
    host="https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com",
    token="your-token"
)
```

### Quick Start

1. Process your dataset:
```python
from data.processing.coco_processor import COCOProcessor

processor = COCOProcessor(spark)
processor.load_coco_annotations("/path/to/annotations.json")
df = processor.process_images("/path/to/images")
```

2. Train a model:
```python
from models.training.ray_trainer import RayTrainer

trainer = RayTrainer(model, num_workers=4, use_gpu=True)
trainer.train(config)
```

3. Evaluate results:
```python
from evaluation.metrics.classification_metrics import ClassificationMetrics

metrics = ClassificationMetrics(num_classes=10)
results = metrics.compute_metrics(predictions, ground_truth)
```

4. Deploy model:
```python
from deployment.ci_cd.deployment_pipeline import DeploymentPipeline

pipeline = DeploymentPipeline(workspace_url, token, model_name, experiment_name)
pipeline.run_pipeline(metrics_threshold)
```
